# Classes and Objects :
## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module ?
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

<br>

## What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of a certain type of object. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that contains specific values for its attributes and methods. Here are some key differences between classes and objects in Python:

>- Classes define the attributes and behavior of an object, while objects are the actual instances of a class that contain specific values for those attributes.
>- A class is a user-defined data type, while an object is an instance of that data type.
>- A class can have multiple objects, each with its own set of values for the class attributes.
>- Classes are defined using the "class" keyword, while objects are created using the constructor method "init()" which is defined within the class.

<br>

To create and manage instances of a class, you can follow these steps:

>- Define the class using the "class" keyword and define its attributes and methods.
>- Create an instance of the class by calling the constructor method "init()" and passing any required arguments.
>- Set the values of the attributes of the object using the dot notation.
>- Call the methods of the object using the dot notation.
>- To delete an object, use the "del" keyword followed by the object name.

# Thinking Recursively :
## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module ?
Problems (in life and also in computer science) can often seem big and scary. But if we keep chipping away at them, more often than not we can break them down into smaller chunks trivial enough to solve. This is the essence of thinking recursively.

<br>

## Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. In a recursive function, the function repeatedly calls itself with a smaller subset of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a problem that can be solved directly without further recursion. Recursive functions are commonly used for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, identical tasks.

Here's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number:

    def factorial(n):

       if n == 0:
           return 1
       else:
           return n * factorial(n - 1)

           print(factorial(5)) # Output: 120

In this example, the function "factorial()" takes an integer "n" as input and returns its factorial. The base case of the function is when "n" is equal to 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function calls itself with "n - 1" as input, and multiplies the result by "n".

In this example, the function calculates the factorial of 5, which is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

### When implementing a recursive function, there are some best practices to follow:

>- Define a base case: Make sure that your function has a base case that will terminate the recursion. Without a base case, your function will keep calling itself indefinitely and cause a stack overflow error.
>- Define the recursive case: Define the recursive case that calls the function with a smaller subset of the problem. The subset should be smaller than the original problem, so that the function eventually reaches the base case.
>- Test your function: Test your function with various input values, including edge cases, to make sure that it works correctly.

# Pytest Fixtures and Coverage :
## What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
pytest fixtures and code coverage are two important concepts in testing Python code. pytest fixtures are functions that provide a fixed baseline for tests, and code coverage is a measure of how much of the code is tested. Both of these concepts can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

pytest fixtures allow you to define reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple tests. For example, if you have a web application that needs to interact with a database, you can define a fixture that sets up a connection to the database and returns it. This fixture can be used in multiple tests, ensuring that the tests have a consistent starting point and reducing duplication of code.

code coverage is a measure of how much of the code is tested by your test suite. Code coverage is important because it helps you identify areas of the code that are not being tested and may contain bugs. Code coverage tools like coverage.py can generate reports that show how much of your code is covered by your test suite.

To use pytest fixtures and code coverage together, you can define fixtures that set up your application for testing, and then use those fixtures in your tests. You can then use a code coverage tool to measure how much of your code is being tested.
