# Linked Lists :
## An analogy for a linked list is to think of it like a train.
In a train, each car is connected to the next car by a coupling mechanism, allowing the train to have flexibility and move around curves and corners. Similarly, in a linked list, each node is connected to the next node by a pointer or reference, allowing the list to have flexibility and easily insert or remove nodes.

Just like in a train, each car can have different contents, such as cargo or passengers, in a linked list each node can have different data stored in it. And just like in a train, you can add or remove cars as needed, in a linked list, you can add or remove nodes as needed.

Another similarity is that in both cases, you can access the cars or nodes in sequence, starting from the first one and moving along to the last one. In a train, you can go from the first car to the last car by following the couplings, and in a linked list, you can go from the first node to the last node by following the pointers.
