# Matplotlib tutorial
## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module ?
matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.

## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are all popular Python libraries used for data visualization. While they share some similarities, they have different strengths and use cases.

Matplotlib is a widely-used library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It offers a high degree of customization and control over plot elements, making it ideal for creating publication-quality graphics. Matplotlib is particularly well-suited for creating line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. For example, suppose you want to plot a line graph showing the monthly sales of a product over time. In that case, Matplotlib can easily create a simple, clean, and customizable visualization that highlights the key trends and patterns in the data.

Seaborn, on the other hand, is a Python data visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics. It is designed to work well with Pandas data frames and has a more streamlined API for common visualization tasks. Seaborn offers a wide range of visualizations, including heatmaps, pair plots, and kernel density estimates, that are useful for exploring complex data sets and identifying patterns and correlations. For example, suppose you want to visualize the distribution of a variable in a data frame using a histogram and a kernel density estimate. In that case, Seaborn can quickly create a detailed and informative visualization that highlights the key features of the data.

Bokeh is a Python library that is specifically designed for creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed in a web browser. It provides a range of tools for creating interactive plots, such as zooming, panning, and hovering, that allow users to explore data in real-time. Bokeh is ideal for creating complex, interactive visualizations that can be embedded in web applications, dashboards, and other interactive data analysis tools. For example, suppose you want to create an interactive scatter plot that shows the relationship between two variables and allows users to select and highlight data points. In that case, Bokeh can create an interactive visualization that allows users to explore the data in real-time and gain insights into the underlying patterns and trends.

In summary, Matplotlib is a versatile library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. Seaborn is a high-level library that is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a streamlined API for creating statistical graphics. Bokeh is a library specifically designed for creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed in a web browser. The choice of which library to use depends on the specific requirements of the visualization and the use case.

## In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics. Seaborn offers a range of functions to create different types of plots, including relational, categorical, and distribution plots.

Relational plots:
Relational plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables. Seaborn provides several functions for creating relational plots, including scatter plots, line plots, and regression plots. One of the most commonly used functions for creating a scatter plot is sns.scatterplot(). This function can be used to plot the relationship between two variables and to explore the correlation between them. For example, if you want to visualize the relationship between the age and the salary of employees in a company, you can use sns.scatterplot() to create a scatter plot that shows how these two variables are related.

Categorical plots:
Categorical plots are used to visualize the distribution of data across categorical variables. Seaborn provides several functions for creating categorical plots, including bar plots, count plots, and box plots. One of the most commonly used functions for creating a box plot is sns.boxplot(). This function can be used to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories. For example, if you want to visualize the distribution of the test scores of students in different classes, you can use sns.boxplot() to create a box plot that shows how the scores are distributed across the different classes.

Distribution plots:
Distribution plots are used to visualize the distribution of data across a single variable. Seaborn provides several functions for creating distribution plots, including histograms, kernel density plots, and rug plots. One of the most commonly used functions for creating a histogram is sns.histplot(). This function can be used to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. For example, if you want to visualize the distribution of the ages of customers of a certain product, you can use sns.histplot() to create a histogram that shows how the ages are distributed.

In summary, Seaborn provides several functions for creating different types of plots, including relational, categorical, and distribution plots. Relational plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables, categorical plots are used to visualize the distribution of data across categorical variables, and distribution plots are used to visualize the distribution of data across a single variable. The choice of which plot to use depends on the specific requirements of the visualization and the use case.
