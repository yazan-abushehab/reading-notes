# In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python
### the key principles of Test-Driven Development are :
### The freela :the client demands .
### Baby Steps :what is the smaller test that we can do against a function (method/class) that will return the desired ouput .
### AAA (Arrange, Act and Assert) :you need to organize the data, then excute the code and check if the result is the same expectation .
### the cycle :Write a unit test and make it fail, Write the feature and make the test pass and Refactor the code .

# If name equals main
### t Allows You to Execute Code When the File Runs as a Script, but Not When It's Imported as a Module.
### Advantages :
### 1-Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
### 2-If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
### 3-Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
### 4-if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

# Recursion
### The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

### Packages are a collection of related modules that aim to achieve a common goal.
### To import all objects (functions, variables, classes, etc.) from a module, we can use the import * statement. For example, to import all objects contained in the hello module, we can use the following statement:
## from hello import *
