# What is Serverless Computing?
## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module ?
Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.

Also important: With serverless, developers never pay for idle capacity. The cloud provider spins up and provisions the required computing resources on demand when the code executes, and spins them back down again—called ‘scaling to zero’—when execution stops. The billing starts when execution starts, and ends when execution stops; typically, pricing is based on execution time and resources required.

## What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates computing resources based on the demand of individual functions or pieces of code. Here are the key characteristics of serverless computing and how it differs from traditional server-based architectures:

>- No Server Management: In serverless computing, developers are relieved from the burden of managing servers and infrastructure. The cloud provider abstracts away the underlying hardware and operating systems, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.
>- Event-Driven Execution: Serverless architectures are event-driven, meaning functions are triggered by specific events or requests. These events can include HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads, or scheduled timers. When an event occurs, the corresponding function is executed.
>- Auto-Scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the computing resources to match the current workload. They allocate resources dynamically, scaling up or down based on the number of incoming events or requests. This ensures optimal performance and cost efficiency, as developers only pay for the actual usage.
>- Granular Billing: With serverless, you pay for the execution time of your functions rather than paying for a fixed amount of server capacity. The billing is granular and based on the number of invocations and the duration of each function execution. This pay-as-you-go model allows for cost savings and better resource allocation.
>- Stateless Execution: Serverless functions are stateless by design, which means they don't maintain any persistent state between invocations. Any required data must be passed in as input or fetched from external storage, such as databases or object storage services. This simplifies the development and scaling of applications.
>- Vendor-Managed Services: Serverless computing platforms often provide additional managed services that can be easily integrated with functions. These services include databases, authentication, messaging queues, object storage, and more. Leveraging these services further simplifies application development.

## What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs enable developers to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as databases, web services, or other applications, in a standardized and controlled manner.

In Python, APIs are commonly used to retrieve data from remote servers, perform actions on remote systems, or integrate with various services. Here's a general process for utilizing APIs in Python applications:

Find and Understand the API: Identify the API you want to work with. Read its documentation to understand its endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, rate limits, and any specific rules or limitations.

Choose an API Library: Python provides several libraries to simplify API interactions. Some popular ones include requests, http.client, urllib, and higher-level libraries like Flask or Django Rest Framework for building APIs. Select a library based on your needs and preferences.

Make HTTP Requests: APIs often use the HTTP protocol, and most Python libraries provide functionality to send HTTP requests and receive responses. You typically use methods like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE to interact with different endpoints. Construct the appropriate request URL, headers, and data payload as required by the API.

Handle Authentication: Many APIs require authentication to access protected resources. Depending on the API, you may need to include an API key, access token, or other credentials in the request headers or parameters. Follow the authentication method specified by the API documentation.

Parse the Response: Once you receive the API response, you'll need to parse the data returned in a format like JSON, XML, or CSV. Python provides built-in libraries like json or xml.etree.ElementTree for parsing JSON and XML respectively. Extract the relevant information from the response to use in your application.

Handle Errors and Exceptions: APIs can return errors or encounter issues. Handle different HTTP status codes and error responses gracefully in your code. Consider implementing appropriate error handling and exception management to handle connectivity problems, rate limits, and other exceptional cases.

Process and Integrate the Data: With the retrieved data, you can integrate it into your Python application as needed. Perform any necessary data manipulation, analysis, or storage operations using Python's rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.

Implement Data Caching and Rate Limiting: To optimize performance and adhere to API rate limits, consider implementing caching mechanisms to store and reuse API responses. This helps reduce unnecessary API calls and improves the overall efficiency of your application.

Remember to respect the terms and conditions set by the API provider, including rate limits, usage restrictions, and proper attribution if required.

By leveraging APIs in Python applications, you can seamlessly access and manipulate data from external sources, enabling powerful integrations and expanding the functionality of your applications.

## What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
The Requests library is a popular Python library used for making HTTP requests to interact with APIs and retrieve data from web services. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses, providing a high-level interface to work with APIs efficiently.

To use the Requests library, you need to install it first. You can do so using pip, the package manager for Python, with the following command:

    pip install requests

Once installed, you can import the library in your Python script:

    import requests

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

    import requests

    # Send a GET request to an API endpoint
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")

    # Check the response status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Successful request
        data = response.json()  # Parse the response as JSON
        # Process the data as needed
        print(data)
    else:
        # Failed request
        print("Error:", response.status_code)


In the above example, we use the get() method from the Requests library to send a GET request to the "https://api.example.com/users" endpoint. The response object returned by the request contains various attributes and methods to access the response data.

We check the response status code using the status_code attribute. A status code of 200 indicates a successful request. If the request is successful, we can parse the response content as JSON using the json() method. Finally, we can process the retrieved data according to our requirements.

It's worth noting that the Requests library provides additional methods to send other types of HTTP requests like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These methods, such as post(), put(), delete(), follow a similar syntax and can include parameters, headers, and request bodies as needed.

The Requests library also supports various features like authentication, headers customization, handling cookies, handling redirects, and more. Consult the Requests library documentation for detailed information on how to utilize these features and further enhance your API interactions.
