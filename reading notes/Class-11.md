## What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter Lab is an advanced web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that provides an interactive computing environment for working with Jupyter notebooks, code, data, and other types of content. It was developed as the next-generation version of Jupyter Notebook and offers several features and benefits that distinguish it from its predecessor.

Some key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab are:

1.Improved interface: Jupyter Lab provides an improved user interface with a modular, flexible, and extensible design. It allows you to arrange notebooks, code editors, terminals, and other content in a more flexible and efficient way.

2.Multi-file editing: Unlike Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab allows you to work with multiple files simultaneously in a single window. This makes it easier to organize and manage your work.

3.Support for different file formats: Jupyter Lab provides built-in support for different file formats, such as Markdown, JSON, CSV, and many others, allowing you to work with a wide range of data types and file formats.

4.Integrated terminal: Jupyter Lab provides an integrated terminal that allows you to run shell commands and interact with the underlying operating system.

5.Customizable user interface: Jupyter Lab allows you to customize the user interface using various themes and extensions, making it more personalized and tailored to your needs.

6.Better code editing: Jupyter Lab provides more advanced code editing features, such as code highlighting, linting, and auto-completion, which help you write code more efficiently.

Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook share many similarities, such as the ability to execute code and visualize data in an interactive way. However, Jupyter Lab offers a more modern and powerful interface with more advanced features and better customization options, making it a preferred choice for many data scientists and researchers.

# Numpy Tutorial
## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module ?
NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

## Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
NumPy arrays are the primary data structure used in NumPy, and they provide a powerful and efficient way to work with numerical data in Python. Here are some basic properties of NumPy arrays:

>- Homogeneous data type: NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they contain elements of the same data type. This makes it more efficient to perform numerical operations on arrays.
>- Multidimensional: NumPy arrays can be multidimensional, meaning they can have multiple dimensions (e.g., 1D, 2D, 3D, etc.). This allows you to work with matrices, tensors, and other complex data structures.
>- Fast and memory-efficient: NumPy arrays are implemented in C and optimized for performance, making them much faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists for numerical computations.

To create a NumPy array, you can use the np.array() function, which takes a Python list as an argument:

    import numpy as np

    # create a 1D array from a list
    a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print(a) # prints [1 2 3 4 5]

    # create a 2D array from a list of lists
    b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    print(b) # prints [[1 2 3]
             #         [4 5 6]]
