# Practice in the Terminal

An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

## The Command Line

### What is it ?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

### how do i get to one?

- If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
- If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free).

### how does it work?

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

## Basic Navigation

- pwd for Print Working Directory
- ls for List the contents of a directory.
- cd for Change Directories.

## File Manipulation

- mkdir for making a directory
- rmdir for remove a directory
- touch for Create a blank file
- cp for Copy a file or directory.
- mv for Move a file or directory
- rm for Delete a file

### NO UNDO

The Linux command line does not have an undo feature. Perform destructive actions carefully.
