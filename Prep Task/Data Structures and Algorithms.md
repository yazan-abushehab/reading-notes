# Data Structures and Algorithms

## 8 Common Data Structures every Programmer must know :

>- Arrays: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, arranged in a contiguous memory location. It allows efficient indexing and accessing of elements.

>- Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of elements, where each element contains a reference to the next element in the list. It provides dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

>- Stacks: A stack is a collection of elements, where the last element added is the first one to be removed (LIFO - Last In First Out). It allows adding and removing elements only from one end.

>- Queues: A queue is a collection of elements, where the first element added is the first one to be removed (FIFO - First In First Out). It allows adding and removing elements from opposite ends.

>- Trees: A tree is a collection of nodes, where each node has a parent and zero or more children. It provides hierarchical structure and efficient searching operations.

>- Graphs: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges, where each edge connects two vertices. It allows modeling complex relationships and finding shortest paths.

>- Hash Tables: A hash table is a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is used to index the value. It allows fast retrieval and insertion of elements.

>- Heaps: A heap is a binary tree data structure, where the parent nodes are always greater (max heap) or smaller (min heap) than their children. It allows efficient sorting and priority queue operations.

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

>- it is important to analyze the requirements of the problem and determine which operations will be performed most frequently, and choose the data structure that is most efficient for those operations. Additionally, other factors such as the size of the data set and memory constraints should also be taken into account when selecting a data structure.

## Recurtion :

>- A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. Recursive functions are often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler sub-problems that can be solved using the same algorithm.
