## solving problems thinking steps

>- Understand the problem statement: The first step is to carefully read and understand the problem statement. You need to know what the problem is asking for, what inputs you will be given, and what output is expected.

>- Break down the problem: Break the problem down into smaller parts or sub-problems. It is easier to solve smaller problems than a big one.

>- Design an algorithm: Design an algorithm to solve each sub-problem. This algorithm can be in the form of pseudocode or a flowchart.

>- Write the code: Once you have designed the algorithm, you can start writing the code. You can use the programming language of your choice.

>- Test the code: After writing the code, you need to test it to see if it works as expected. Test the code with various inputs, including edge cases.

>- Optimize the code: Finally, you can optimize the code if required. You can look for ways to make the code more efficient and reduce its time and space complexity.

It is also essential to practice regularly, as solving programming problems requires a lot of practice. Additionally, you can seek help from online resources, books, or mentors to enhance your problem-solving skills.

## best Tips to think like programmer



>- Understand the problem: Start by understanding the problem statement and what it's asking for. Break it down into smaller sub-problems if necessary.

>- Plan your solution: Think about how you can solve the problem, and what steps you need to take. Write down your plan in pseudocode or a flowchart.

>- Divide and conquer: Break the problem down into smaller parts or sub-problems, and solve each of them individually. Then combine the solutions to solve the bigger problem.

>- Debugging: Debugging is a crucial part of programming. When things go wrong, use a systematic approach to find the problem, and fix it.

>- Test your code: Test your code with various inputs, including edge cases. Make sure it works as expected.

>- Refactor your code: Once you have a working solution, you can optimize your code by refactoring it. This involves making your code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

>- Learn from your mistakes: If you encounter errors or bugs, don't get discouraged. Instead, learn from your mistakes, and use that knowledge to improve your problem-solving skills.

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that can be developed and improved with practice. Keep practicing, and you'll become a better programmer over time.
